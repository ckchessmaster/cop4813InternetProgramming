  <h3><a href="assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a></h3>
  <p>
    There were two main parts to this assignment both of which were done primarily in php. For the first part I was tasked with creating a login manager. <br />
    To do this I used a simple form and then checked the username and password against a users file. You can try it out by using the following username<br />
    and password: <strong>admin Password123</strong> As an alternative you can create your own user <a href="assign5/manage.php">here</a>. Don't worry as can be seen <a href="assign5/users.txt">here</a>, all passwords are first<br />
    hashed before stored.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the second part I had to create a basic stock portfolio management system. I display a dashboard of the user's portfolio listing their total worth.<br />
    I then give the user the options to add more stock, delete all shares of a stock, or modify the amount of stock currently held. All transactions are<br />
    logged in a file which can be found <a href="assign5/transactions.log">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of this project I finally started to implement bootstrap in my website as well.
  </p>
  <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To become familiar with using php.</li>
    <li>To demonstrate critical thinking in solving a real world business problem.</li>
    <li>To become familiar with common web apis and how to use them.</li>
